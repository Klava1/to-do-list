## Features

- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Check off tasks as you complete them to keep track of your progress.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed or were added by mistake.
- **Filter Tasks**: View all tasks, only the active ones, or those you've completed to better organize your workflow.
- **Persistence**: Your tasks are saved in your browser, so you can close the app and come back later without losing your progress.

## How to Use the App

Getting started with My To-Do List is easy:

1. **Add a Task**: Click on the input field at the top, type in your task, and press `Enter` or click the "Add" button.
2. **Mark a Task as Complete**: Click on the checkbox next to a task to mark it as complete.
3. **Delete a Task**: Click on the trash bin icon next to a task to remove it from your list.
4. **Filter Tasks**: Use the tabs at the bottom to filter tasks based on their completion status.

## Technologies Used

My To-Do List is built with the following technologies:

- **React**: Utilizes React for building a fast, scalable, and simple to use user interface. React's component-based architecture enhances the app's reusability and maintainability.
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the application.
- **CSS3**: For styling the application and making it responsive to fit on various devices.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Employs modern JavaScript, integrated seamlessly with React to add interactivity and manage the application state.
- **Netlify**: For hosting the application, ensuring it is accessible anywhere and anytime.

By leveraging React, My To-Do List benefits from the framework's efficient update and rendering system, making the user experience smoother and more dynamic.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
